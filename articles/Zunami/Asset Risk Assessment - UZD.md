- What problem does it solve?
  

Zunami Protocol eliminates the challenges of self-managing assets, making it easier for you to focus on growing your wealth in the decentralized finance ecosystem

- Why we created Zunami Protocol?

While yield farming has seen a surge in popularity, it is still not widely adopted. Zunami identified pain points in existing solutions that deter both new and experienced users in the crypto world. Zunami's goal is to bridge the gap between traditional finance and DeFi and create the ultimate solution for stablecoin holders with Zunami Protocol.

Zunami's omni-pool lets users deposit stablecoins (DAI, USDC, and USDT) **directly** or **optimally** and get ZLP tokens that reflect the total value of the protocol‚Äôs funds and earnings. Zunami invests the stablecoins in a few strategies (currently 3) that provide liquidity to Curve pools and stake the received Curve LP in Convex or StakeDAO reward contracts.

The protocol operator regularly triggers the auto-compound method for Zunami, which collects and reinvests rewards from all strategies into Curve pools and reward contracts, boosting the value of ZLP and enabling compound interest for users. The protocol takes a cut in the form of performance fee which is sent to the protocol treasury.

### Strategies

Zunami offers the Omni pool, for users to deposit three types of stablecoins: USDT, USDC, and DAI. These funds are then allocated to multiple strategies that provide liquidity to various pools and protocols in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The selection and rebalancing of these strategies is determined by a DAO vote.

The DAO‚Äôs role is to identify new and profitable strategies, propose them to the Zunami community, and ensure timely rebalancing and diversification of funds across different pools and protocols. Regardless of which strategy the funds were allocated to, each depositor in Zunami will receive a ZLP token that represents their proportionate contribution to the protocol‚Äôs total funds and earnings. All profits generated by the Zunami Protocol will be distributed among ZLP holders, with the exception of a performance fee which will be directed to the treasury for further development and maintenance of the protocol.

Zunami simplifies the complex DeFi ecosystem by creating and automating strategies that involve depositing into Curve and staking LP tokens in StakeDAO or Convex. Zunami also sells the rewards for users, especially those with small deposits who may face high fees or time constraints, enabling them to enjoy compound interest.

As of 15th May 2023, the strategy used and the breakdown is as follows:

![](file://D:\üî¥ Project\Markdown\Risk Report\assets\2023-05-15-17-53-22-image.png?msec=1685000807890)

Silo

XAI is an over-collateralized stablecoin with a soft peg to the US Dollar. With the approval of SiloDAO, XAI will serve as the second bridge asset alongside ETH in the Silo lending protocol.

Clever

clevUSD is backed by FRAX and can be redeemed through a furnace or exchanged in the Curve pool. Clever deposits the user's collateral in the selected auto-compounding Concentrator strategy vault, which includes three strategies: FRAX/USDC, LUSD/FRAXBP, TUSD/FRAXBP. Clever periodically claims the accrued yield from the Concentrator, converts it to FRAX, and distributes an equivalent amount of newly minted clevUSD proportionally to all depositors.

Magic internet money

MIM is a stablecoin that is soft-pegged to the US Dollar and minted by the Abracadabra.money (decentralized lending platform). Abracadabra uses interest-bearing crypto assets as collateral to mint MIM, which can be swapped for other stablecoins.

### Token Overview

##### ZLP

ZLP is a portfolio token that represents an investment positions in all the listed strategies and one can get it via investing USDC/DAI/USDT/FRAX in the protocol.

Both ZLP and UZD has voting rights.

The yield is collected and after taking performance fee it is converted to stable-coins and is re-invested.

ZLP can be redeemed with zero fees.

##### UZD

UZD is a rebase stablecoin token that increases in quantity in proportion to the APY of the Zunami Protocol. It is backed by stablecoins that are allocated in the strategies i.e. Curve Finance pools. UZD is minted using ZLP, which are the liquidity provider (LP) tokens of the Zunami Protocol.

![](file://D:\üî¥ Project\Markdown\Risk Report\assets\2023-05-23-02-59-04-image.png?msec=1685000807835)

UZD has mechanisms to keep it pegged to a $1. The buy side depeg (UZD > 1) can easily be arbed by minting more UZD. The sell side depeg (UZD < 1) can be resolved by redeeming UZD which has 0.5% fee.

UZD 1.2 is a updated version was announced in mid March 2023 and the UZD 1.1 was released in October 2022.

With UZD 1.2, it has become a ‚Äúpool-aware‚Äù token, meaning it stops rebasing when it‚Äôs in a pool but continues when it‚Äôs outside. Team multisig can add address where they wish to stop the rebasing.

This prevents unwanted changes in the pool‚Äôs balance and reduces slippage. When a chunk of UZD (UZD in pools) are not rebasing, there is extra value in the system which can either be used to pay to the UZD holders or utilize in other operation that grows the protocol. Zunami opt for the later approach i.e. utilizing the extra value in bribing/locking/voting in favor of their protocol.

![](file://D:\üî¥ Project\Markdown\Risk Report\assets\2023-05-16-17-39-21-image.png?msec=1685000807836)

Moreover, UZD pool also earns rewards from Curve & Convex.<mark>The received CRV and CVX are locked to gain veCRV and vlCVX positions, which are the voting tokens from Curve and Convex respectively. These are used for voting on the best strategies for the Zunami Protocol.</mark>

### Algorithmic Peg Stabilizer

APS is a recently launched mechanism that is used to balance the UZD in the UZD/FraxBP such that the depeg can be avoided.

If there is an imbalance in the pool towards an increase in the FRAXBP proportion, APS withdraws USDC from the pool, deposits them into Zunami Protocol, mints UZD, and then deposits them ![üîô](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f519.svg "Back with leftwards arrow above")back into the pool.

In case of an imbalance towards a large amount of UZD in the pool, APS either withdraws them to a vault strategy or performs UZD redemption, followed by withdrawing USDC and depositing them into the UZD/FRAXBP pool.

APS is also a yield destination where a user can deposit their UZD to earn more rewards that originate from the UZD pool.

APS is available through a new UZD Staking section on the website. 
The benefits for the user include:

-  ![ü´∞](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1faf0.svg "Hand with index finger and thumb crossed") Inexpensive deposit/withdrawal of funds through the vault strategy.
-  ![üîÅ](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f501.svg "Clockwise rightwards and leftwards open circle arrows") Rewards are automatically sold and reinvested.
-  ![‚öñÔ∏è](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/2696.svg "Scales") Funds are diversified and rebalanced across UZD pools on various DEXs.

Zunami team is pursuing to![üîê](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f510.svg "Closed lock with key") close the ability for users to independently mint/redeem UZD and deposit directly into the APS. ![üè¶](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f3e6.svg "Bank") Those who wish to receive native UZD yield can simply buy it through a DEX, and for a yield boost, stake it in APS.![ü§ñ](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f916.svg "Robot face")

### Zunami Protocol Economics

![](file://D:\üî¥ Project\Markdown\Risk Report\assets\2023-05-23-03-27-39-image.png?msec=1685000807888)

UZD is collateralized by stablecoins that are stored in Curve pools, generating income. UZD is also a rebase token, meaning that the quantity of UZD increases in proportion to the income generated by its collateral, equivalent to the APY of Zunami.

While in the Curve pool, UZD's rebase function is disabled, and the rewards in CRV, CVX, and FXS are directed to Zunami's treasury instead of being sold to increase the quantity of UZD. The UZD economy is designed in such a way that the rewards generated are enough to cover the next bribe and maintain pool incentives, creating a self-sustaining cycle where bribes essentially pay for themselves.

When the manual minting and redemption is closed, APS will the sole minting and burning mechanism for UZD. Zunami obviously wants adoption of their stable coin UZD and would aim for a supply increase. For a user to consider buying UZD, the use case for UZD needs to be better than that of the ZLP.

The above is true in context of a user interacting with Zunami because the yield to hold ZLP is similar to that of holding UZD. The negative to hold UZD rather than ZLP is an extra risk of smart contract; the positive is that a user has a chance to take advantage of an arbitrage opportunity but this is not an ideal reason.

The only destination where yields are greater than just holding UZD is staking it on zunami in APS or manually providing liquidity on Curve and staking the LP tokens on another protocol.

# Risk Vectors

## Smart Contract Risk

### Audits

Zunami v2 is currently under a re-audit.

Zunami Protocol has had an external [audit](https://github.com/ZunamiLab/ZunamiProtocol/tree/main/audit) performed by [Ackee Blockchain](https://ackeeblockchain.com/) prior to launch (Feb 22, 2022). 
UZD stablecoin has also been [audited](https://github.com/ZunamiProtocol/ZunamiStable/blob/main/audit/abch-zunami-uzd-report.pdf) by the Ackee Blockchain (Oct 1, 2022).
In the February 2023 Zunami Protocol and UZD v1.2 stablecoin has been audited by the [HashEx](https://hashex.org/). Links on the reports:
Zunami Protocol: [Zunami Protocol Security Audit by HashEx](https://hashex.org/audits/zunami-protocol/) UZD: [Zunami Stable (UZD) Security Audit by HashEx](https://hashex.org/audits/zunami-protocol-uzd/)

### Concerns

#### Ackee Blockchain - Zunami Audit

> We can‚Äôt recommend deploying contracts in the current state since the system does not behave as described in the documentation and endanger users‚Äô funds.
> 
> Zunami Audit by ackee bloackchain: Conclusion

> Developers updated the code regarding our findings across the severity spectrum. Critical and high issues have been fixed, medium and low recommendations have been applied.
> 
> ...
> 
> The codebase has become more readable and looks more
> professional also due to the added NatSpec format documentation. However, one new minor issue (M9) appeared.
> 
> Zunami Audit by ackee bloackchain: Conclusion

M9: The new variable usdtPoolId has no write access across contracts. It should be constant.

#### HashEx - Zunami Audit

> 6 high, 4 medium, 15 low severity issues were found during the audit. 1 medium, 8 low issues were resolved in the update.
> 
> The reviewed contracts are highly dependent on the owner‚Äôs account. Users using the project have to trust the owner and that the owner's account is properly secured.
> 
> This audit includes recommendations on code improvement and the prevention of potential attacks.
> 
> Zunami Audit by HashEx: Conclusion

The `deposit()` function is open for public calls, but withdraw is possibly only via Zunami contract, meaning any user, who deposits directly, will lose his tokens.

Some findings were focused on slippage where 100% is possible. Where no external checks are done.

- Default deposit/withdraw pid change
  a. The admin has to control the actual¬†withdraw pid has sufcient lpshares amount to service 
  users withdraw needs, otherwise users will be unable to return their assets;
  b. The admin has to control, while setting default withdraw/deposit pool, that addressed 
  strategy has similar or close price of used liquidity token for staking, otherwise it will cause 
  unfair distribution of `lpshares`.
  
- Lacks of validation on strategy duplication
  There is no check the strategy had not been already included when new pool is added. As once added strategy can't be removed, it will result to permanent `totalHoldings` miscalculation and consequently `lpshares` unfair distribution
  

### HashEx - UZD Audit

- Address balance can be switched between elastic and rigid
  The owners have access to both¬†`addRigidAddress()` and¬†`removeRigidAddress()` functions, making it possible to convert desired addresses between rebasing and non-rebasing states. 
  This could result in malicious actions, for example, if converting to rebasing a protocol that doesn't support rebasing tokens. Third-party protocol owners must consider this possibility before adding the UZD token. Users must accept risks before using semi or fully decentralized 
  protocols with UZD tokens

Users should also consider that there are high number of protocols involved, which increases the overall smart contract risks

## Custody Risk

As quoted before Zunami highly depends on the owner‚Äôs account. Users using the project have to trust the owner and that the owner's account is properly secured. To counter this, their long term solution is to diversify the governance among the active and reputed DeFi users.

![](file://D:\üî¥ Project\Markdown\Risk Report\assets\2023-05-18-14-42-11-image.png?msec=1685000807838)

The protocol team is fully doxxed which is positive considering the above situation.

## Governance Risk

Zunami does not employ immutable governance but uses snapshot to conduct governance based decisions. Thus the control still remains with the team which eliminates the risk of someone maliciously use governance power to manipulate the protocol's/users' funds.

The majority proposals are focused on new strategies for ZLP.

![](file://D:\üî¥ Project\Markdown\Risk Report\assets\2023-05-21-15-45-24-image.png?msec=1684698324585?msec=1685000807839)

Voting is still taking place in the form of ZLP/UZD

## Depeg Risk

UZD is collateralize by ZLP's value and ZLP is collateralize by the investments in the strategies (currently MIM/3CRV, clevUSD/FRAXBP, XAI/FRAXBP pools on curve).

Thus if ZLP loses it's value, UZD can get depegged i.e. if USDC, FRAX, DAI, MIM, clevUSD or XAI depegs, the value of ZLP will get impacted.

Moreover, Zunami has another mechanism that would adjust the UZD supply in the curve pool based on the demand. Zunami calls it Algorithmic Peg Stabilizer mechanism.

## Collateral Risk

### MIM

MIM is resilient with it keeping the peg a well as recovering from a depeg. Since it would take time for the market to realize that UZD's value is compromised due a strategy token depeg, the effect of a sudden de-peg and recovery would have almost negligible impact on UZD pool on Curve.

![](file://D:\üî¥ Project\Markdown\Risk Report\assets\2023-05-21-16-28-02-image.png?msec=1685000807840)

### ClevUSD

clevUSD was sucessfully grant a gauge and had undergone a risk assessment by the llamaRisk [Asset Risk Assessment: CLever clevCVX & clevUSD](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/asset-risk-assessment-clever-clevcvx).

Here are some relevant conclusions from the risk report:

> Users are exposed to maturity risk when holding clevTKN. This maturity risk can be realized through time or value because the clevTKN can rarely trade at the same value as TKN unless the amount of clevTKN deposited in the furnace is less than the TKN generated from the yield.

clevUSD is performing exceptionally well in this aspect.

> The inverse relationship between the quantity of clevTKN in the Furnace and the presumed market price of clevTKN suggests that a high reliance on liquidity incentives will be required to support the peg.

> CLever's strategy vaults have undergone thorough auditing, and the Concentrator protocol utilized in clevUSD vaults has also undergone auditing. These ensure reasonable precautionary efforts against smart contract exploitation.

### XAI

XAI had undergone a risk assessment by the llamaRisk: [Asset Risk Assessment: Silo Finance.](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/asset-risk-assessment-silo-finance) The risk report does not conclude with any major concerns with respect to XAI.

Here are some relevant comments from the risk report:

> The team is working on two¬†[initiatives](https://gov.silo.finance/t/building-on-chain-liquidity-for-xai/309)¬†that will ensure the initial provisions of adequate liquidity. First, seeding the initial USDC silo with 1.875M USDC to mint 1.5M XAI. Deposit the minted 1.5M XAI plus an additional 1.5M USDC into a¬†[Uniswap V3 pool](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x55bb9904df17f3b07551aa117841b3bbfc66646d). The Uni pool is only temporary to ensure smooth liquidations. Once Silo‚Äôs own liquidation engine is able to support Curve pools, they will migrate liquidity to the XAI/FRAXBP pool. However, this might take a few weeks to finalize. And secondly, Silo will use 130k of their own vlCVX to vote for incentivization of their pool. Hence, we believe there will be enough liquidity for the early stage of XAI.

> Silo is still in an early stage, the beta version of its siloed lending market only went live at the end of August 2022. And the stablecoin XAI is just about to be created as we write this report. Even though adoption is still low, Silo has a promising use case and a great setup to be successful. Another promising sign is that Silo has already implemented on-chain governance. Thus, SILO voters are already in control. Even though voting power is rather centralized around the team, it is great to see a protocol implementing decentralized governance early on.

> Although the basics look promising, Silo still has to prove its use cases and grow significantly to achieve its goals. As of today, the lending platform has very little organic TVL or borrowing volume.

# LlamaRisk Gauge Criteria

(An analysis of all the above findings are used to answer the following questions, which we ultimately use to determine whether we recommend a gauge or not)

Centralization Factors

1. Is it possible for a single entity to rug its users?
  
  No. In the worst case, the team can switch to a malicious strategy where users still have 24 hrs to extract their funds before the funds get allocated to the malicious strategy.
  
  If the users are fairly active, their principal capital is safe.
  
2. If the team vanishes, can the project continue?
  
  No. There are a lot of moving parts that are currently controlled by the team. The balancing trigger for APS is in the hands of team which is a crucial peg stabilizing mechanism.
  

Economic Factors

1. Does the project's viability depend on additional incentives?
  
  Yes. Holding UZD grants the same value as holding ZLP so the only reason for a user to hold UZD is to deposit it somewhere where the user can get more yield than ZLP itself. APS is/ will be used to control the supply of the UZD via staking mechanism. For the UZD supply to increase, there need to be yield destinations that provide better APY than ZLP.
  
2. If demand falls to 0 tomorrow, can all users be made whole?
  
  Yes. UZD is backed by ZLP and ZLP is backed by the investments in the strategies (curve pools + staked on convex or stakeDAO). UZD is fully collateralize with other stable coins.
  

# Risk Team Recommendation

(Don't worry about this section in the first draft, we will discuss together and with the protocol team to determine our final recommendation)
